%% Calculating speedup factor running MCMC chains in parallel vs. serially
% The benefit of parallelization will only become apparent when running inference problems
% that take a long time to complete. In this case, the overhead cost of reading and writing
% files (which is done serially) is relatively small. In this example, we run the simple
% rate inference model with an extremely large burnin and calculate the speedup factor
% running seven MCMC chains in parallel vs. serially. This script was executed on a 
% 8 core machine. Performance benefits will vary between machines.
%
%%% Model Definition
% The BUGS example was taken from the WinBUGS course developed by Michael Lee and Eric-Jan
% Wagenmakers at <http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/BayesCourse/BayesBook.html>
%
% In this example, the goal is to infer a rate with the following model: 
%
% <html>
% <table border=0><tr><td>
% model {<br>
% &nbsp;&nbsp;  # Prior on Rate<br>
% &nbsp;&nbsp;  theta ~ dbeta(1,1)<br>
% &nbsp;&nbsp;  # Observed Counts<br>
% &nbsp;&nbsp;  k ~ dbin(theta,n)<br>
% }<br>
% </td><td>
% </table>
% </html>
%
% This script is stored in the text file "Rate_1.txt"
% The data is initialized in Matlab with variables k (number of successes) and n (total number of observations). In the rate problem, the
% goal is to get samples of theta, the rate of Beta distribution in the model
